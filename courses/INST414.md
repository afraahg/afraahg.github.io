#### Course Information

This course explores the application of data science techniques to unstructured, real-world datasets including social media and open data sources. The course will focus on techniques and approaches that allow the extraction of information relevant for experts and non-experts in a wide range of areas including smart cities, transportation or public safety. This course will explore approaches to extract insights from large-scale datasets. The course will cover the complete analytical funnel from data extraction and cleaning to data analysis and insights, interpretation, and visualization. The data analysis component will focus on techniques in both supervised and unsupervised learning to extract information from datasets. Topics will include clustering, classiﬁcation, and regression techniques.  Through homework assignments, a project, exams and in-class activities, students will practice working with these techniques and tools to extract relevant information from structured and unstructured data.

Course objectives include:

- Collect and clean large-scale datasets.
- Articulate the math behind supervised and unsupervised techniques.
- Execute supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- Select and evaluate various types of machine learning techniques.
- Explain the results coming out of the models.
- Critically evaluate the accuracy of diﬀerent algorithms and the appropriateness of a given approach
