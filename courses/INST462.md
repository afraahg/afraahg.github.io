#### Course Information

This course situates the practice of data visualization within a larger context of data literacy and data ethics. The goal of this course is to introduce students to both principles and techniques of data visualization, for the dual purposes of 1) exploring data and 2) communicating findings. Students will learn the value of visualization, specific techniques in information visualization and scientific visualization, and how to leverage visualization methods for data exploration and communication.
Using visualization techniques and tools, we will build interactive visualizations that combine data and logic with storytelling and design. We will dive into cleaning and structuring unruly data sets, examine how different chart
types work for different types of data, and unpack the tactics behind effective visual communication. With an eye towards critical evaluation of both data and method, projects and discussions will be geared towards interdisciplinary
and relatable research data.

Course objectives include:

- Utilize key techniques and theory used in visualization.
- Read and discuss research papers from the visualization literature.
- Locate and prepare data for visualization.
- Choose which chart type works best for different types of data.
- Design visualizations using best practices for design and accessibility.
- Use R Studio to create visualizations
